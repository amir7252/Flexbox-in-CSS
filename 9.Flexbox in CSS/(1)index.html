    <h1>CSS Flexbox Layout Model</h1>
    <p>Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout model that allows you to manage space distribution and alignment between items in a container. It’s designed for one-dimensional layouts, either in a row or a column.</p>

    <h1>CSS Grid Layout Model</h1>
    <p>CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that allows you to work with rows and columns simultaneously. It’s designed for larger-scale, two-dimensional layouts.</p>

    <h1>When to Use Flexbox vs Grid</h1>
    <p>Use Flexbox when you’re dealing with layout in a single dimension – either a row or a column. It’s best suited to application components and small-scale layouts.</p>
    <p>Use Grid when you’re working with a two-dimensional layout – both rows and columns. It’s designed for larger-scale layouts that are not linear in design.</p>
    <p>Remember, the choice between Flexbox and Grid depends on the specific layout needs of your project. They can also be used together, where Flexbox can be used to control the layout of individual items within a Grid container.</p>
